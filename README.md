# Uncommon JavaScript Bug: Implicit Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to implicit null handling. The function `foo` handles null inputs, but this handling might not be obvious or sufficient in all contexts.  This makes the code fragile and prone to errors if the null handling logic changes elsewhere in the application.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust solution.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the initial buggy code.  The function explicitly handles null values by returning 0. However, this approach might not be appropriate for all use cases. This implicit assumption is a common source of errors in larger applications.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents an improved version. The solution uses explicit error handling or alternative approaches (such as optional chaining or nullish coalescing) to handle null or undefined values more gracefully and explicitly.
